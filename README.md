This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

"TGFTT" stands for "That Guy From That Thing."  The goal of this application is to help you when you're trying to think of a specific actor, director, movie, tv show, etc., but you're drawing a blank.

# Goals
- Ability to search for an actor by listing movies / tv shows that they have appeared in
- Ability to search for a movie / tv show by listing the actors that appear in it
- Ability to search for major crew (directors, writers, etc) based on their movies or frequent collaborators
